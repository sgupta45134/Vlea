Before creating a new Moodle account the plugin will attempt to match against an Arlo contact record. The options for matching are:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Method 1</strong>
<br>
Arlo FirstName, LastName and Email - This will attempt a match between the group of fields (Arlo Contact FirstName, LastName and Email) and (Moodle user firstname, lastname and email).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Method 2</strong>
<br>
Arlo CodePrimary - This will attempt a match between fields Arlo Contact CodePrimary and Moodle user idnumber.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Method 3</strong>
<br>
Will try <strong>Method 1</strong> if no match will then try <strong>Method 2</strong>.

If no match is found using any of the Methods a Moodle user account will be created based on Arlo Contact details.
