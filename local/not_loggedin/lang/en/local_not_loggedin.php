Greetings from Amity Online!!

 

It has been observed from the Learning Portal logs that you have not logged in/accessed your courses on the AMIGO LMS since you have taken admission.

 

For an online/ distance course, learning portal is very important aspect to fulfil the norms as well as the learning part.

 

You are requested to Login to the LMS and complete your tasks on time.

 

This is also to remind that, you have to go through all the contents and submit the periodic assignments for you to successfully complete your course/ program.

 

Do you know? Most of the students doing their education through the Distance/Online mode loose career opportunities and end up paying more money than required due to lack of regularity and academic planning!!

 

 

Happy Learning !

Team Amity Online
